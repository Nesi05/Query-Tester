# Query-Tester
Realizing a Query Tester
create an HMI for entering an SQL query in a field;

start the execution of the query with a button on a toolbar;

if the query returns 0 or more results, display them in a JTable;

the name of the columns should be visible;

in case of error, a pop-up (JOptionPane) containing the message will be displayed;

a small message at the bottom of the window will display the execution time of the query as well as the number of rows returned.
